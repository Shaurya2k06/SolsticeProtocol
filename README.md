# The Solstice Protocol - Zero-Knowledge Identity on Solana

## What is The Solstice Protocol?

The Solstice Protocol is a revolutionary zero-knowledge identity verification system built on Solana that leverages India's Aadhaar infrastructure for seamless dApp authentication. By utilizing the unique QR codes from the mAadhaar app and Light Protocol's ZK compression technology, Solstice creates a privacy-preserving, cost-effective, and scalable solution for Web3 identity verification.
